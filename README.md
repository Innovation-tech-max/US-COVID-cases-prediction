# Time series analysis and forecasting of coronavirus disease in US using LSTM and SARIMA model.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network(RNN) capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems.

And, the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, or SARIMA method is used for time series forecasting with univariate data containing trends and seasonality.
It is an extension of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, or ARIMA.
